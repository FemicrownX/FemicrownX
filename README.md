# Applied AI Researcher | Trustworthy AI & RAG Systems

**Applied AI Researcher** addressing the fundamental tension between interpretability and accuracy in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. Specializing in the design of domain-specific AI systems that mitigate hallucination and algorithmic bias in high-stakes educational environments.

Methodological expertise includes constructing vector-based knowledge bases (FAISS), implementing fairness-aware evaluation metrics, and transforming black-box model predictions into transparent, human-verifiable insights for institutional policy decision-making.
